# Single Player Pong

Single Player Pong is a vertical-scrolling twist on the classic arcade game. Built with Python and Pygame, it challenges you to keep one or more balls in play using a paddle at the bottom of the screen.

## Features

- Balls speed up after bouncing off the top wall or your paddle
- Yellow power-ups briefly appear and duplicate any ball that passes through them
- Blue power-ups slow down every ball for a few seconds, giving you time to react
- The game ends only when every ball is missed

## Requirements

- Python 3.9 or later
- [Pygame library](https://www.pygame.org/)

## Installation

Clone the repository and install Pygame:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

## Running the Game

```bash
python main.py
```

Use the arrow keys to move the paddle and to navigate the menu. Press Enter to confirm menu choices.
